# My Awesome Project
This project was coded during the second week of class to demonstrate the various Git commands, such as:

* git **log**
* git **add**
* git **commit**
* git **diff (--staged)**
* ignoring files with **.gitignore**

## Initial Commit
The very first commit should almost always use the commit message "initial commit."

## Second Commit
Added the following JavaScript to the JS file

```
var laurensInfo = {
  firstName: 'Lauren',
  lastName: 'Yockey',
  clearanceLevel: 'Top Secret',
  rank: 93,
  likesRunning: true
};
```
